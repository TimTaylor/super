NOTE: super is still somewhat experimental in nature and should be treated as
such until the 0.1.0 release. The package is not yet on CRAN but should
hopefully land there in the near future.

The development version of super can be installed from r-universe:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('super', repos = c('https://tim.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```
